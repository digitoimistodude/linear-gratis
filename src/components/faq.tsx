    question: 'Is my data secure?',
    answer:
      'Your Linear API token is encrypted with AES-256 encryption before storage. We never store your Linear data – we fetch it in real-time when visitors view your boards. All connections are secured with HTTPS.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does the Linear API token work?',
    answer:
      'You create a personal API token in Linear\'s settings. We use it to read your projects and issues. The token only has read access unless you enable issue creation on your public views.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if linear.dude.fi shuts down?',
    answer:
      'We\'re fully open source. You can self-host the entire platform, and your data stays in your Linear workspace. There\'s no lock-in – your Linear data is always yours.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Are there any limits?',
    answer:
      'No limits on forms, views, roadmaps, or submissions. We don\'t throttle usage or restrict features based on plan tiers because there are no tiers – everything is free.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How is this completely free?',
    answer:
      'We believe Linear accessibility shouldn\'t be paywalled. The project is maintained by the community and runs on minimal infrastructure. It\'s free because we think it should be.',
